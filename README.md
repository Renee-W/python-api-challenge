I  selected my random cities late at night while it was snowing.  When I looked at the data in the vacation file, none of the vacation cities were in the US (didn't meet the max temp/wind/cloudiness criteria).  This gave me a lot of vacation spots throughout the world - but mostly in the southern hemisphere to visit.
I took the information I learned in this exercise and created another file (CampPy).  Recently we purchased a Winnebago Revel and have been trying to decide where to take it.  I took my initial file of cities, narrowed it down to the contiguous US (where I can drive to) and searched for the nearest campground to the city and mapped out campgrounds.
